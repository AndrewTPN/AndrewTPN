# Today I Learned — Two Sum (Hash Map)
# Date: Jan 16, 2026
#
# Problem:
# Given a list of numbers and a target, return the indices of two
# different numbers that add up to the target.
#
# Approach:
# While looping through the list, I keep a dictionary of numbers
# I’ve already seen (value -> index). For each number, I check if
# its complement (target - current number) is already in the dict.
#
# If yes, I return the two indices. If not, I store the current
# number and move on.
#
# Important points:
# - Using a hash map avoids the O(n^2) brute force solution.
# - This works in one pass through the array.
# - Duplicates are handled naturally by only matching with
#   previously seen values.
# - Negative numbers don’t cause any issues.
#
# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(n)
#
# Example:
# nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9  -> [0, 1]


'''
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

 
Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

#solution guide. 
'to deal with this problem, we need to know how to reverse a number first, them we can compare if the index is same as revered number. if same, then it is palindrome, otherwise not palindrome.'

# create the function
def isPalindrome(self, x):
    # negative numbers are not palindrome
    if x < 0:
        return False
    
    # convert number to string and reverse it
    reversed_x = str(x)[::-1]
    
    # compare original number with reversed number
    return str(x) == reversed_x
# test the function
print(isPalindrome(121))  # Output: True
print(isPalindrome(-121))  # Output: False
'''after this case, i learned how to reverse a number by using string slicing, and also learned that negative numbers are not palindrome. so we can return false directly when the input number is negative. then we can convert the number to string and reverse it by using slicing [::-1]. finally, we compare the original number with the reversed number, if they are same, then it is palindrome, otherwise not palindrome.'''
