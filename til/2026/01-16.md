# Today I Learned — Two Sum (Hash Map)
# Date: Jan 16, 2026
#
# Problem:
# Given a list of numbers and a target, return the indices of two
# different numbers that add up to the target.
#
# Approach:
# While looping through the list, I keep a dictionary of numbers
# I’ve already seen (value -> index). For each number, I check if
# its complement (target - current number) is already in the dict.
#
# If yes, I return the two indices. If not, I store the current
# number and move on.
#
# Important points:
# - Using a hash map avoids the O(n^2) brute force solution.
# - This works in one pass through the array.
# - Duplicates are handled naturally by only matching with
#   previously seen values.
# - Negative numbers don’t cause any issues.
#
# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(n)
#
# Example:
# nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9  -> [0, 1]
