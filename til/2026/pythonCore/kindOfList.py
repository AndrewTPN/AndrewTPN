# why do we use linked list compare to normal list?
'''1. Linked list is more efficient to add and remove items in the middle of the list.
    normal list: O(n)
    linked list: O(1)

'''
# 2. Linked list is more efficient to access the items in the middle of the list.
# 3. Linked list is more efficient to traverse the list.
# 4. Linked list is more efficient to insert and delete items in the middle of the list.
# 5. Linked list is more efficient to search for an item in the list.
# 6. Linked list is more efficient to sort the list.
# 7. Linked list is more efficient to merge two lists.
# 8. Linked list is more efficient to split a list into two lists.
# 9. Linked list is more efficient to reverse a list.
# 10. Linked list is more efficient to find the middle of a list.
